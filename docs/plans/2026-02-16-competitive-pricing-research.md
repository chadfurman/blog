### Retention Drivers (What Makes Plans Sticky)

1. **Hosting lock-in** — migration friction is your biggest retention tool
2. **Monthly reporting** — clients who see reports stay 2-3x longer
3. **Relationship > transaction** — plugin audit positions you as consultant
4. **Fear of the unknown** — 90K attacks/min target WordPress; monthly security reports reinforce this
5. **Upsell gateway** — $99 care plan keeps relationship warm for Growth/E-Commerce upsells
6. **Support dependency** — regular touchpoints deepen the relationship

### LTV Analysis (The Real Revenue Model)

| Year 1 | $500 + $1,188 = **$1,688** |
| Year 2 | cumulative **$2,876** |
| Year 3 | cumulative **$4,064** |

Beats a freelancer charging $1,500 one-time with no recurring relationship.

### Recommendations for Starter Site

| Priority | Action |
|---|---|
| Medium | Consider raising to $650-$750 (still way below $1,500 freelancer avg) |
| Medium | Raise per-page add-on to $100 |
| Low | Fix inconsistency: callout says "$300 with care plan" but service page says "$500" |
| Info | 2-week delivery is a major differentiator (industry avg: 4-8 weeks) |
